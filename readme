				I had to develop a cfg analysis of java program 
				the languyage i used is c++.
				so  as in case of a compiler ihad to parse the whole program and cobnvert it into a intermediate form for teh analysis.
				this was done by use of a parser written.



this is a function used to print a vector of string

these three functions are used to trima string

this function is basicallyused to move everything after else toa next line


handle rb function basically takes a line finds the br string and splits what is after and before br as well as br into three lines it is used to handle { } as well as if

this function removes extra lines 
parse function does the actual parsing ofthe input file and returns a intermidiate parsed file.





the next file is classees file which is used to dicribe the various clases used.this is still in work in development and i am changing structure of class as and when  the use case changes

inst class is used to store a instruction 
type defines three types of instructions 
]instlist containts a list of instructions insed a bracketof ifor while etc

instruction stores the dactual instructions. 

method class is used to stpore a fucntion
